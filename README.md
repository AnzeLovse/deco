DECO: R package
Decomposing heterogeneous population cohorts for patient stratification and discovery of subclass biomarkers using omic data profiling.
---------------------------------------------------
Here, we present a tutorial to use DECO, a new method to explore and find differences in heterogeneous large datasets usually  produced in biological or biomedical omic-wide studies. The method makes a comprehensive analysis of multidimensional datasets (usually consisting on a collection of samples where hundreds or thousands of features have been measured with a large-scale high-throughput technology, for example, a genomic or proteomic technique). The method finds the differences in the profiles of the features along the samples and identifies the associations between them, showing the features that best mark a given class or category as well as possible sample outliers that do not follow the same pattern of the majority of the corresponding cohort. The method can be used in a supervised or unsupervised mode, it allows the discovery of multiple classes or categories and is quite adequate for patients stratification.
